# Client-Server-Communication-Project
This repository contains a simple Python client-server application. The server listens for connections, processes data with a 10-second delay, and returns modified responses. The client connects, sends messages, and displays processed responses with timestamps. The server uses threading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
